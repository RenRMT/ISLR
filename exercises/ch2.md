## Applied exercises

### This exercise relates to the College data set, which can be found in the file College.csv

1)  Use the read.csv() function to read the data into R. Call the loaded
    data college. Make sure that you have the directory set to the
    correct location for the data.

``` r
college <-read_csv("../data/college.csv")
```

2)  Look at the data using the fix() function. You should notice that
    the first column is just the name of each university. We donâ€™t
    really want R to treat this as data. However, it may be handy to
    have these names for later.

``` r
# I a personally not a fan of using rownames. I think it's better to keep this row as a character column.
college <- college %>% tibble::column_to_rownames("...1")
```

3)  

``` r
# i 
summary(college)
```

### This exercise involves the Auto data set studied in the lab.

``` r
Auto <- read_csv("../data/Auto.csv")
```

Which of the predictors are quantitative, and which are qualitative?

``` r
numeric <- lapply(Auto, function(x) is.numeric(x))
numeric
```

    $mpg
    [1] TRUE

    $cylinders
    [1] TRUE

    $displacement
    [1] TRUE

    $horsepower
    [1] FALSE

    $weight
    [1] TRUE

    $acceleration
    [1] TRUE

    $year
    [1] TRUE

    $origin
    [1] TRUE

    $name
    [1] FALSE

2)  What is the range of each quantitative predictor? You can answer
    this using the range() function.

``` r
Auto_num <- Auto[which(numeric == TRUE)]
lapply(Auto_num, function(x) range(x))
```

    $mpg
    [1]  9.0 46.6

    $cylinders
    [1] 3 8

    $displacement
    [1]  68 455

    $weight
    [1] 1613 5140

    $acceleration
    [1]  8.0 24.8

    $year
    [1] 70 82

    $origin
    [1] 1 3

3)  What is the mean and standard deviation of each quantitative
    predictor?

``` r
lapply(Auto_num, function(x) {
  list(
    mean = mean(x),
    sd = sd(x)
  )
}
)
```

    $mpg
    $mpg$mean
    [1] 23.51587

    $mpg$sd
    [1] 7.825804


    $cylinders
    $cylinders$mean
    [1] 5.458438

    $cylinders$sd
    [1] 1.701577


    $displacement
    $displacement$mean
    [1] 193.5327

    $displacement$sd
    [1] 104.3796


    $weight
    $weight$mean
    [1] 2970.262

    $weight$sd
    [1] 847.9041


    $acceleration
    $acceleration$mean
    [1] 15.55567

    $acceleration$sd
    [1] 2.749995


    $year
    $year$mean
    [1] 75.99496

    $year$sd
    [1] 3.690005


    $origin
    $origin$mean
    [1] 1.574307

    $origin$sd
    [1] 0.8025495

4)  Now remove the 10th through 85th observations. What is the range,
    mean, and standard deviation of each predictor in the subset of the
    data that remains?

``` r
Auto_num %>% slice(-(10:85)) %>% 
  lapply(function(x) {
  list(
    mean = mean(x),
    sd = sd(x)
  )
}
)
```

    $mpg
    $mpg$mean
    [1] 24.43863

    $mpg$sd
    [1] 7.908184


    $cylinders
    $cylinders$mean
    [1] 5.370717

    $cylinders$sd
    [1] 1.653486


    $displacement
    $displacement$mean
    [1] 187.0498

    $displacement$sd
    [1] 99.63539


    $weight
    $weight$mean
    [1] 2933.963

    $weight$sd
    [1] 810.6429


    $acceleration
    $acceleration$mean
    [1] 15.72305

    $acceleration$sd
    [1] 2.680514


    $year
    $year$mean
    [1] 77.15265

    $year$sd
    [1] 3.11123


    $origin
    $origin$mean
    [1] 1.598131

    $origin$sd
    [1] 0.8161627

5)  Using the full data set, investigate the predictors graphically,
    using scatterplots or other tools of your choice. Create some plots
    highlighting the relationships among the predictors. Comment on your
    findings.

<!-- -->

6)  Suppose that we wish to predict gas mileage (mpg) on the basis of
    the other variables. Do your plots suggest that any of the other
    variables might be useful in predicting mpg? Justify your answer.
